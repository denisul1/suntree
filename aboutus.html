    <h1>What is Suntree?</h1>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      We are a group of people who really love nature. For that, we created a
      company named "Suntree" and we decided to sell fruit trees and bushes.
      Right now our main goal is to become the best version of ourselves. Many
      of us had studied horticulture, which is a critical requierment in this
      domain. This helps to constantly improve our products and even our image.
      Our business relies on a friendly environment in which cooperation and
      adaptability are 2 of the most important traits anyone can have.
